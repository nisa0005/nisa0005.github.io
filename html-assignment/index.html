        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <!-- Paragraph 1 containing superscript & emphasis -->
        <p>Hello! My name is Arzin Nisar. I was born on December 17<sup>th</sup>, 2005, in Ottawa, Canada. I was born into a family consisting of my older brother, my father, and my mother. Shortly after my birth, my family and I moved to Dubai. I lived there for about 5 years in the <em>scorching</em> heat, until we moved to Toronto and then finally returned to Ottawa. I don't remember much about my childhood, but something that has remained consistent throughout my years is my love for cats!</p>
        <!-- Paragraph 2 containing abbreviation -->
        <p>Today, I am 17 years old. I graduated from <abbr title="West Carleton Secondary School">WCSS</abbr> and I am now attending Algonquin College. In my free time, I enjoy participating in visual art activities. I typically stick to drawing humans, but I do enjoy drawing animals from time to time. Some other hobbies of mine are building Legos, gaming, reading, and petting my cat. </p>
        <p> This is a motivational quote from one of my favourite books:</p>
