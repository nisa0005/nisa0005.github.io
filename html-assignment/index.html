        <!-- Paragraph 1 containing superscript & emphasis -->
        <p>Hello! My name is Arzin Nisar. I was born on December 17<sup>th</sup>, 2005, in Ottawa, Canada. I was born into a family consisting of my older brother, my father, and my mother. Shortly after my birth, my family and I moved to Dubai. I lived there for about 5 years in the <em>scorching</em> heat, until we moved to Toronto and then finally returned to Ottawa. I don't remember much about my childhood, but something that has remained consistent throughout my years is my love for cats!</p>
